📌 Credit Card Risk Modelling

This project focuses on building a risk prediction model to classify credit card applicants/customers as low-risk or high-risk based on their financial and demographic profiles.

🔑 Key Features

Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables).

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing default risk.

Built and compared machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict default probability.

Achieved an accuracy of 0.81 using XGBoost, with balanced recall to reduce false negatives.

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for performance optimization.

Designed an interpretable model using Feature Importance for explainability.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, XGBoost, LabelEncoding, OneHotCoding)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

📊 Outcome

Delivered a robust credit risk model with 81% accuracy (XGBoost).

Provided actionable insights for financial institutions to improve credit risk assessment and decision-making.
